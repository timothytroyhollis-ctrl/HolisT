## Reflections for Week 3

### The Less Challenging

This assignment offered a valuable opportunity to explore the shape and behavior of financial data using summary statistics and visualizations. Some portions felt intuitive, like calculating mean, median, and mode, and interpreting boxplots to highlight central tendency and spread. These steps helped reinforce the importance of choosing the right summary metrics for different types of data.

### The More Challenging

The more challenging aspects involved interpreting statistical moments like skewness and kurtosis, and designing binning logic for histogram-style comparisons across regions. These required deeper attention to how R handles breaks, labels, and edge cases when translating numeric distributions into categorical bins.

### My Biggest Learnings

Visualizing dispersion through IQR and boxplots helped clarify which metrics were most reliable for skewed data, while the regional breakdowns revealed at times subtle, yet meaningful differences in pricing and sales behavior.

Overall, this assignment strengthened my ability to narrate data clearly, troubleshoot binning logic, and present insights that go beyond surface-level summaries. Iâ€™m excited to carry these skills forward into future analyses.
